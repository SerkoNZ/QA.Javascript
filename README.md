## This is a NodeJS project for use in the Quality Assistant/Analyst interview auditions.
## Purpose
The goal of the session is to automate scenarios for the login page of the `demoApp`.

There are 2 technology options for you to choose to go with:
- option 1 is `webdriverIO/mocha` (driven by webdriverIO)
- option 2 is `jest/selenium-webdriver` (driven by jest)

Please refer to individual readme files (in the option1/2 subfolders) in order to:
- run the demo app locally 
- run tests against it
